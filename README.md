# Data Visualisation
This is our Data Visualization project. It was completed by us in Second Year of Computer Engineering while studying at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering.


The dataset that we have taken up from the Kaggle is from the year 2015. The reason why we chose this dataset was basically because of the fact that In todayâ€™s time, where everyone is busy in their daily commitments, it would be safe to say that the priority of whether we are happy or not is on the decline but it is something that largely impacts our day to day functioning.

Here, we visualized the data and saw how various factors affect the Happiness score of different countries.
